# absorbance-data-project
This repository will hold all things relevant to my final project in my Environmental Data Analytics class, ENVIRON 872L. The project will focus on UV absorbance characteristics in northern lakes.

The following was summarized from the original READ_ME file for NTL_LTER Lake datasets, prepared by Kateri Salk. 

# NTL-LTER Lake - Carbon Dataset - README Information


## Summary

This Northern Temperate Lakes dataset contains data from studies on several lakes in the Northern Wisconsin and in Michigan's Upper Penninsula. Data were collected as part of the Long Term Ecological Research station established by the National Science Foundation.

## Database Information

Raw data were given to the Environment 872L class in the original repository created by Instructor Kateri Salk. The original data were found at the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research website, https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/about/overview.

The full name of the dataset is **Cascade Project at North Temperate Lakes LTER Core Data Carbon 1984 - 2016**. This was saved in the project's repository as a csv file in the "raw-data" folder, and it was titled "NTL-LTER_Lake_Carbon_Raw.csv"

Data were first accessed by Kateri Salk on 2018-12-06, but again accessed for this project on 2019-04-01.

## Data Content Information

Data on dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, particulate organic matter, partial pressure of CO2 and absorbance at 440nm. Samples were collected with a Van Dorn sampler. Organic carbon and absorbance samples were collected from the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion. Inorganic samples were collected at depths corresponding to 100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and 1% of surface irradiance, as well as one sample from the hypolimnion. Samples for the partial pressure of CO2 were collected from two meters above the lake surface (air) and just below the lake surface (water). Sampling frequency: varies; number of sites: 14


POC, PON and DOC: 1. 100 - 300 ml (Typically ~200mL for PML, 150 metalimnion and 75 – 100 for the hypolimnion) of lake water from each depth was filtered through 153 um mesh to remove large zooplankton. Water was then filtered through a precombusted 25mm GF/F filter (0.7 um pore size) at less than 200 mm Hg pressure. Filters were placed in drying oven at 60 C to dry for at least 48 hours. 20mL of filtered water was stored in a scintillation vial and acidified with 200uL of 2N H2SO4 for DOC analysis. Blank samples for POC and DOC were prepared with deionized water to control for contamination. All samples were sent to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies for analysis.

Absorbance: 60ml of water was filtered through a 25mm GF/F filter and refrigerated until it was able to be run. Samples were warmed up to room temperature and run on a spectrophotometer in a 10cm glass cuvette. The spectrophotometer was set to 440nm and blanked with deionized water. The cuvette was rinsed once with sample water and then filled and absorbance was measured.

DIC: Water was sampled with a van dorn and taken back to the lab. 10 mL subsamples were taken with syringes and 200 uL of 2N H2SO4 and 20 mL of helium gas were added to the syringe. Syringes were shaken for one minute and 10 mL of the helium headspace was injected into a Gas Chromatograph with Thermal Conductivity Detector to determine DIC concentration.

PCO2: Air PCO2 was measured by filling a syringe with air from two meters above the lake surface and running though the GC. Water PCO2 was measured by filling a two liter bottle with lake surface water and replacing 60 mL of water with atmospheric air for headspace. The bottle was shaken for 100 seconds and two subsamples of the headspace were taken and run though a GC in the lab.
